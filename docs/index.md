# Analysis of New York City Vehicle Collisions

Each year, vehicle collisions in New York City injure approximately 40,000 people and kill more than 200 people. Understanding where, when, and why collisions occur is essential to reducing the number of people injured and killed. 

To better understand where and when collisions occur we:
- [Map where collisions occur]({{ "/content/maps" | relative_url }})
- [Identify hot spots]({{ "/content/hotspots" | relative_url }})
- [Review trends]({{ "/content/trends" | relative_url }})
- [Compare collisions by NYPD precinct]({{ "/content/police" | relative_url }})
