Dangerous areas are multi-block clusters of collisions with injuries or deaths. Clustering may reveal high-risk areas that would be missed by focusing on single points (like intersections) with many collisions. Clusters were identified by tuning a density-based clustering algorithm, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#dbscan">Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)</a>.
