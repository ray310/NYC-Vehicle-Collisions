# Dangerous Areas for Pedestrians and Cyclists
Dangerous areas for pedestrians and cyclists are clusters of collisions with a high number of pedestrian / cyclist injuries and deaths from vehicle collisions. Clusters were identified by tuning a density-based clustering algorithm.

Please visit the project [GitHub page](https://github.com/ray310/NYC-Vehicle-Collisions) to see how this map was made.
