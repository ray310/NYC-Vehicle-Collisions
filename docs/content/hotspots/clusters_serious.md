# Dangerous Areas
Dangerous areas are clusters of collisions with a high number of injuries and deaths from vehicle collisions. Clusters were identified by tuning a density-based clustering algorithm.

Please visit the project [GitHub page](https://github.com/ray310/NYC-Vehicle-Collisions) to see how this map was made.
