# Hotspot Maps
Identifying concentrations of collisions
- [Dangerous Locations]({{ "/content/hotspots/points_serious" | relative_url }})
- [Dangerous Locations for Pedestrians]({{ "/content/hotspots/points_non_motor" | relative_url }})
- [Dangerous Areas]({{ "/content/hotspots/clusters_serious" | relative_url }})
- [Dangerous Areas for Pedestrians]({{ "/content/hotspots/clusters_non_motor" | relative_url }})

_Dangerous locations are single points where collisions are common_

_Dangerous areas are clusters identified by clustering algorithm_
